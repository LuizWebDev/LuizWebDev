- 👋 Hi, I’m Luiz, brazilian-portuguese living in London for over five years now. Dreaming of becoming a full-stack web dev.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development (I know...you guessed that lol) but beyond it I love to workout at the gym (gym buddies welcome), travelling around the world, helthy food and meeting friends.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and css and others technologies (and I'm loving it!) as well as doing a bootcamp on web development at futureproof academy. I feel like I cant wait to be really good on it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects on web develpment, web dev students groups and anything related to the dev community.
- 📫 How to reach me ...you can email-me at luizwagnermelo@hotmail.com !
